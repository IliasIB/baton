# baton
This sync-tool was made because of the scarce supply of sync-tools that are able to provide a fast syncing for multiple services (Google Drive, ownCloud, Onedrive...). Sync-tools for seperate platforms exist, but use slow methods (like checking the complete remote location for changes). Baton changes this by providing a framework on which syncing for different services can be provided. It also adds a basic set of syncing for some well-known services.
